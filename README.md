Developed an Image Captioning System that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. The model integrates CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequence generation, enabling accurate and context-aware image descriptions. Implemented in Python, leveraging TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning and OpenCV for image processing.
